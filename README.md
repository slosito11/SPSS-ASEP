# SPSS - ASEP

## Swiss Physics Student's Society - Association Suisse des Ã‰tudiants en Physique

___

Welcome to the repository on which we'll try to build the SPSS-ASEP.


The purpose of this society will be to represent the Swiss Physic's Students (SPS <- to change because obvious conflict with the [SPS](https://www.sps.ch/en/sps)) nationally and internationally, and to become part of [IAPS](https://www.iaps.info/) and to go to their events. To promove and do cool things for physics in switzerland.

We will do it in english as main and hopefully we'll have a team of translators for the other french german and italian.

We will organize an event in Geneva to create all of this (Hopefully before september 2023 so that we can go to [ICPS](https://www.icps2023.com/) in phillipines!!!). Therefore we need to (decreasing importance):

- [#1] Create statute
- [ ] Contact all swiss physic's student associations, start with contacting the ones from [this](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/organisation/members)
- [ ] Ask [SPS](https://www.sps.ch/en/sps) to help us and create a relationship with them
- [ ] Create our website and host it somewhere
- [ ] Contact [IAPS](https://www.iaps.info/) once we are sure enough that we can exist so we can apply in time to go have fun with them
- [ ] Create a party to go to [PLANKS](https://www.iaps.info/events/plancks/plancks-2023-in-milan/)
- [ ] Create a recurring party or similar for annual reunion !
- [ ] Have ideas what to do
- [ ] translate



This project is sustained by the followings (Student's associations and on same line the university, other associations and so on that support the project through them):
